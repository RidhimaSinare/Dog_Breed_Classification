End-to-end Multi-class Dog breed classification
This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using Tensorflow 2.0 and Tensorflow Hub

1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog

2. Data
The data we are using is from Kaggle

3. Evaluation
The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

4. Features
Some information about the data:

we are dealing with unstructured data(images) so its best to use deep learning or transfer learning.
There are 120 breeds of dog i.e 120 different classes
There are around 10,000+ images in training test and test set individually.
train set has labels , test does not have labels
